# VIM Amazing

Configuration for the best Editor ever made, that makes it AMAZING.

### What is this repository for?

Used for distributing my VIM configuration around for developing in C, Rust, and Python.

### How do I get set up?

First make sure you are using a current full version of VIM, meaning not VIM-tiny or VI.

Download the .vimrc file and put it in the home directory, or clone the repo and create
a symbolic link.  (i.e. ~/.vimrc)

[VIM-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used for Plugins, and is
[automatically](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tips#automatic-installation) installed.
When you first enter VIM, it will attempt to bootstrap all Plugins.

The default install will use Airline and DevIcons so it's best to head over to Nerd Fonts,
and get your favourite font with all the good stuff load in the terminal before using
this VIM configuration.
